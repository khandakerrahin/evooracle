A Java project includes a class called `{{ class_name }}` and it has the following method details as JSON:
`{{ method_details }}`.
Generate a test oracle for a JUnit test case based on the above information and DEVELOPER COMMENTS of the method to test its functionality.

In the following the test case, replace the `{{ assertion_placeholder }}` with an appropriate assertion:
```
{{ test_method_code }}
```
THE ASSERTION STATEMENT MUST FOLLOW ONE OF THE FOLLOWING PYTHON REGEX PATTERNS:
```r'(\w+\.)?(assert|assertTrue|assertNull|fail|assertFalse|assertNotEquals|assertEquals|assertArrayEquals|assertNotNull|assertNotSame|assertSame|assertThat)\s*\(.+?\);'```
JUST WRITE THE ASSERTION, NO EXPLANATION NEEDED.
